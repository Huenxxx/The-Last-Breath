# Prototype 0 - Issues and Next Steps

## Current Status
**Prototype 0 - COMPLETED**
- ✅ Procedural terrain generation
- ✅ RTS-style camera system
- ✅ Player character with movement
- ✅ 2 wandering NPCs
- ✅ Unit selection system (up to 3 units)
- ✅ Click-to-move with pathfinding
- ✅ Basic interaction system
- ✅ Save/load functionality
- ✅ GameManager integration
- ✅ Main scene setup

## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **NavMesh Not Auto-Generated**
   - **Issue**: NavMesh needs to be manually baked in Unity Editor
   - **Impact**: Pathfinding won't work in builds without pre-baked NavMesh
   - **Solution**: Implement runtime NavMesh generation or ensure NavMesh is baked before build

2. **Missing Visual Feedback**
   - **Issue**: No visual indicators for selected units
   - **Impact**: Hard to see which units are selected
   - **Solution**: Add selection rings or outline shaders

3. **No Animation System**
   - **Issue**: Characters don't have walking/idle animations
   - **Impact**: Characters slide instead of walking
   - **Solution**: Implement basic animation controller with blend trees

### Medium Priority
4. **Basic Placeholder Graphics**
   - **Issue**: Using primitive shapes (capsules, cubes) for all objects
   - **Impact**: Game looks very basic
   - **Solution**: Create or import basic 3D models

5. **No Audio System**
   - **Issue**: No sound effects or music
   - **Impact**: Silent gameplay experience
   - **Solution**: Add basic audio manager and placeholder sounds

6. **Limited Interaction Feedback**
   - **Issue**: No UI prompts for interactions
   - **Impact**: Players may not know what's interactable
   - **Solution**: Add interaction prompts and UI elements

7. **Save System Limitations**
   - **Issue**: Save system is basic and may not handle all edge cases
   - **Impact**: Potential data loss or corruption
   - **Solution**: Improve error handling and validation

### Low Priority
8. **No Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue**: No object pooling or LOD systems
   - **Impact**: May have performance issues with more objects
   - **Solution**: Implement basic optimization systems

9. **Limited Debug Tools**
   - **Issue**: Debug overlay is minimal
   - **Impact**: Hard to debug issues during development
   - **Solution**: Expand debug tools and visualization

10. **No Input Validation**
    - **Issue**: No bounds checking for camera or character movement
    - **Impact**: Characters/camera can move outside intended areas
    - **Solution**: Add proper boundary systems

## Blocked Items

### Requires Unity Editor Access
- **NavMesh Baking**: Need to bake NavMesh in Unity Editor before building
- **Material Assignment**: Need to assign proper materials to avoid pink textures
- **Scene Setup**: Need to ensure all GameObjects are properly configured

### Requires External Assets
- **3D Models**: Need character and item models
- **Textures**: Need terrain and object textures
- **Audio**: Need sound effects and music files

### Requires Additional Development
- **UI System**: Need proper UI framework for menus and HUD
- **Animation System**: Need character animation controllers
- **Shader System**: Need custom shaders for visual effects

## Next Milestone: Prototype 1

### Planned Features
1. **Inventory System**
   - Grid-based inventory UI
   - Item tooltips and descriptions
   - Drag and drop functionality

2. **Basic Combat System**
   - Click-to-attack mechanics
   - Health and damage system
   - Simple combat animations

3. **Crafting System**
   - Basic recipes and workstations
   - Resource consumption
   - Crafted item generation

4. **Enhanced Visuals**
   - Basic 3D models for characters
   - Improved terrain textures
   - Selection indicators

5. **Audio Integration**
   - Background music
   - Sound effects for actions
   - Audio settings

### Estimated Timeline
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Priority**: High impact features first
- **Dependencies**: Asset creation, UI framework

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Improve error handling throughout
- Add XML documentation for all public methods
- Implement proper logging system

### Architecture
- Consider ECS migration for performance
- Implement proper event system
- Add configuration management
- Improve separation of concerns

### Performance
- Profile and optimize critical paths
- Implement object pooling
- Add LOD system for distant objects
- Optimize terrain generation
